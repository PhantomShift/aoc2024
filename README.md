# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions for Advent of Code 2024.

As of writing the solutions are written in rust;
to run each solution, run

```bash
cargo run -p dayX
```

where X is the day. Input (`input.txt`) and test (`test.txt`) files
must be placed in the same directory as the relevant binary (ergo src/day1/src/)
to successfully build/test.
